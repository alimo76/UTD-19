# UTD-19 Urban Cities- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## introduction 
this project focuses on performing a complete Eloratory Data Analysis (EDA) on UTD-19 dataset.
The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization. Dataset includes 40 Urban cities. Plus, there are two datasets, 
one contains detectors location information and the other includes traffic measurements of each detectors.

Key steps in this EDA: 
- Loading and exploring the dataset structure
- Detecting missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering (Time engineering)
- Visualizing distributions, feature relationships and Geo plot with long and lat data. 

## Data source 
The dataset used in this project is publicly available.
